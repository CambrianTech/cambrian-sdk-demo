# Cambrian SDK Demo
This is a fully functional demo illustrating augmented reality in seamless still and video modes, and also a dynamic color finder that finds colors from images or video. We have chosen an objective-c libary to allow for backwards compatibility, but we recommend development in swift and using a bridging header to load the framework. This method has been employed in the demo.


## Installation

###### Install git-LFS
The framework is rather large prior to compilation and therefore requires git-lfs to be installed to download the CambrianAR.framework from this repository. Instructions on installing git-lfs are here. If you are using a client such as tower or sourcetree, make sure the the application is referencing the correct version of git that you installed. Git LFS may be found here: https://git-lfs.github.com/

###### Include the binary:
Add the binary into your project by dropping the framework into the Embedded Binaries section.

###### Run Script Build phase:
Add the following shell script as a "New Run Script" in XCode for your app's target. This is necessary to strip out the x86 contents prior to release to the app store or installation onto a device. We must package both the x86 and arm slices in one embedded binary. Because Apple does not provide this facility, this script is necessary. *Important: this must be the last script in the process.*

```
if [ -f "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/CambrianAR.framework/strip-frameworks.sh" ]; then
bash "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/CambrianAR.framework/strip-frameworks.sh"
fi
```

## Implimentation

#### Overview
The Cambrian Remodeling SDK consists of various views, such as a `CBRemodelingView` to do augmented reality in video and still mode or a `CBColorFinderView` to find colors in an image. They are sub classes of `UIView` and handle the GPU and touches for you. They may be placed directly into a storyboard or instantiated directly and pass events, such as colors found or a tool utilized (`historyChanged`) as a delegate callback. In general, add the framework to your project and change a view's class within your user interface to `CBRemodelingView` or `CBColorFinderView`. The SDK is written in Objective-C, but has utilized Swift compatible types and nullability so it will work well with either language. 

Getting this SDK to run requires only providing a view in your storyboard that is `CBRemodelingView` and calling the method `startRunning()`.


#### `CBRemodelingView` extends `CBAugmentedView`
This is the video and still based view for changing paint colors or flooring. After being added to a view controller, it will either create a scene automatically if not provided or load an existing one. 



```
property (weak, nonatomic, nullable) id<CBRemodelingViewDelegate> delegate; 
weak var delegate: CBRemodelingViewDelegate?
```

Delegate method for receiving events, such as tool actions or undo steps

```
@property (nonatomic, strong, nonnull) CBRemodelingScene scene;  
*var scene: CBRemodelingScene?
```

A scene is a project that can be loaded or saved. It contains all information about the current view, such as paint colors used and flooring assets. To change what is present in augmented reality, interact with this property.

```
@property (nonatomic, assign) CBToolMode toolMode;*  
var toolMode  
```

Tool mode is to control what user touches do in a remodeling scene. 

`CBToolModeNone`: Do nothing

`CBToolModeFill`: Fill paint from a point

`CBToolModeUnfill`: Remove a filled area

`CBToolModePaintbrush`: Smart drawing tool (paints up to edges with rough touches)

`CBToolModeEraser`: Smart eraser tool


```
@property (nonatomic, readonly) BOOL isRunning;  
*var isRunning: Bool*  
```

Property indicating whether the video based augmented reality is active.

#### State methods

```
(void) captureCurrentState;  
func captureCurrentState() 
```

Capture from video to still

```
(BOOL) startRunning;
func startRunning()
```

Start running video based augmented reality

```
(BOOL) stopRunning;
func stopRunning() 
```

Pause augmented reality.

```
(void) clearAll;
func clearAll()
```

Remove all assets from scene

#### History methods and properties

```
@property (nonatomic, readonly) int undoSize;
var undoSize: Int
```

This indicates how many undo steps are possible.

```
(void) undo;
func undo()
```

Undo last action, such as paint color or something painted

```
@property (nonatomic, readonly) int redoSize;
var redoSize: Int
```

This indicates how many redo steps are possible.

```
(void) redo;
func undo()
```

Reverse last undo action.

### CBRemodelingViewDelegate
When providing your class as a delegate to CBRemodelingView, receive events.

```
(void) historyChanged:(CBUndoChange)change assetID:(NSString *)assetID userData:(NSDictionary<NSString, NSString>)userData forward:(BOOL)forward;
func historyChanged(_ change: CBUndoChange, assetID: String, userData: [String: String], forward: Bool)
```

This event indicates the user has performed some action, such as painting, but also redoing or undoing an action.

## CBRemodelingScene
A scene object contains all asset information, such as paints and flooring, that have been utilized in an image. It is from this object, which is part of a remodeling view, that the content is controlled. It is also how projects can be saved, loaded, or copied.

#### Initialization
```
(nullable CBAugmentedScene ) initWithSceneID:(nonnull NSString*)sceneID;
init(sceneID: String)
```

Initialize with a unique scene ID, usually a UUID.

```
(nullable CBAugmentedScene ) initWithUIImage:(nonnull UIImage *)image;
init(uiImage image: UIImage)
```

Initialize from an image, such as a user's gallery. ID created from an autogenerated UUID

```
(nullable CBAugmentedScene *) initWithUIImage:(nonnull UIImage *)image sceneID:(nonnull NSString*)sceneID;  
init(uiImage image: UIImage, sceneID: String)
```

Initialize from an image, such as a user's gallery, assigning a scene ID.
